Welcome to my first blog post!I am so excited to share with you MORE of what theLastBlog has to offer! The amount of ideas, how-to’s and inspiration whirling around in my head is ready to jump out. I wanted to start by telling you why I created this blog, what you will be seeing more of in my posts, and my overall experience of revamping my website.



Since I started my college, many of my friends have asked me “Why don’t you start a blog?!” and up until a few months ago did I truly know what a “blog” was. WRONG I WAS. After doing much research and making friends along the way, who have been so kind to offer much support and advice, I have become completely consumed with inspiration to start theLastBlog. I have finally realized all of the benefits that blogging can bring.


## What you will be seeing more of in my posts

personal experience will obviously be the main topic of my blog, but get ready because you will be seeing much more of the face behind (me). Writing has been a strong suite of mine. I may be a “perfectionist” but I am nowhere near perfect. I figure it will be a lot of trial and error so please bear with me and please feel free to always share your advice and communicate with me along the way! I hope to inspire you because truthfully, you all inspire me and I am looking forward to bringing you a more organized way of living.
