Its been quite some time since the last blog (pun intended); but I'm back to blogging and I hope i will be more regular, would probably weekly blog.Just finished the part 1 of last season of [Attack on Titan](https://myanimelist.net/anime/40028/Shingeki_no_Kyojin__The_Final_Season) and my ohh my what a banger of a final season it was although I have read the manga but still watching the anime was so good maybe because i knew what was coming and the studio didn't disappoint with animations,Cant wait for next part. (probably winter 2022 ?)


Also I turned 21 last week, but turning 21 didnt seem like it , it was so natural and not overwhelming at all, usually we zoomers hype the 21st so much I was happy to have a good day with my family, tho a special friends message made my day <3.


P.S. If you know you know
