Ahhh!! A new year, the same old me? I finally remembered about this blog just kidding, been procrastinating a lot more so I had no motivation to write blog posts.Finally I’m in some good headspace to start blogging again, How frequently ? Honestly the answer to that question is difficult at the moment.With all things said, I am grateful to everyone and anyone who reads this blog.

As of writing this blog its half past four in the morning and I’m wide awake thanks to my fucked up sleep schedule, was excited to get back to college this week and hangout with friends catch up to college life but seems like that has to wait. Yeah you all guessed it right COVID seems like that old bitch just does not want to leave us anytime soon honestly she has stayed longer than my ex (tried to bad mouth my ex). Recently I’ve taken quite a liking to geography(honestly one of my favourite subjects back in high-school), so I've been watching quite a lot of videos by a channel called [RealLifeLore](https://www.youtube.com/c/RealLifeLore); Video essays are kinda dope ngl.

Recently, I attended my cousin’s wedding. It has been a long time since I visited any of my cousins and relatives so I was kinda happy to see them all and spend time together. Honestly speaking some of them were kinda conscious and weird around so it took some time to break the ice and after that we all had fun and enjoyed a typical Indian wedding.

Also the latest season of Demon Slayer is airing right now so I was kinda hyped about it as well, it's been quite a good show that lived up to its expectations. Just watched the latest episode before writing this blog, the episodes henceforth are gonna be banger, while we are on the subject of shows, we watched the latest show of witcher, the show was fire kinda excited for the next season.

This was a life update blog so will keep it short and trust me this time I am going to be regular; until next time here is the customary anime pic
