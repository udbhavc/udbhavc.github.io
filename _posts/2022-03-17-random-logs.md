EDIT- 3/16/2022

This post is written over a period of three months, trying a different kinda blog-style. If you find it enjoyable please let me know, glhf reading, these are  just my normal logs which i write ever so often these days, coz im a lazy dawg who just does not want to research on some interesting topics. xD

Waking up is such a hassle these days not because I have nothing to do or I'm not focused towards my life, it's just that my favourite coffee ran out of stock and I have a caffeine problem I guess, one of the many problems in my life (copium). Interestingly a friend of mine who btw is  real sweetheart (i'm lying ofc she is the worst)  got me to take a mbti personality test (im INTP btw if you are interested) and that got me thinking, although in reality the purpose of MBTI is to raise awareness of your own preference, which is a total lie, such bs if you ask me it just entails the seek of validation of your own qualities imagine teenagers fixated on wanting a certain type of personality or such which just pulls you so much from your real true self, but enough of me being a smartass or at least trying to be a one.

You know the day was uneventful when I had to log about the time I went outside, but being a hindsight harry today was for a fact eventful.Pune in general is such a beautiful place unless you are 5 mins late at the University Circle during rush hours in the morning, but the thing i love about this city is the everyone’s life here is so fked up we dont go giving people silly advice instead we say this “Dokyat Jau Nako” for all the non marathi folks that's the punekar way of saying please mind your own business and leave me alone.

Exams week over, did not log anything worth sharing, fickle as it may sound have not watched any new anime, instead watched the latest Demon slayer season with my friend and that mf could not resist cliffhangers while he was binging and me who would wait for a week for the next episode.\
Started the chainsaw man manga once again, hopefully i don't burnout this time and finish it.\
P.s. quordle makes my head ache sometimes, hurting a lot these days tho.\
Also notice the date.


04/03/2022, and the following weekend\
Just had my Hachiman, Miyamura and yada yada yada moment but i reacted irrationally weirdchamp
All good, day well spent, reminder to not always joke around and be douche. The weekend was very tiring and eventful, with the workload and no time to go out even if I wanted to, so no complaints from my side, I started rewatching oregairu cause why not? Honestly because I didn't want to not start anything because the new Kaguya-Sama season  and SpyxFamily comes next month and also Komi-San cour 2 in April (iirc) and 86 coming from hiatus next week. It's the spring Season baby LFG.

Holi break followed by episode 22 of 86, imho if she watched 86 in the era of AoT she is the one.
Just got off watching the latest episode of 86, the symbolism of the black-bars changing into white when Lena acknowledges Shin, symbolism of the red spider lily. It's too much man, just too much.\
The new glasses came and my head hurts a ton, please get me out of this misery, also twitter should get a restricting feature where my certain tweets are not visible to some people.

If you have made this far, what are you doing man, why are you like this ?? Jk.\
Happy Holi Guys!!, this was very raw, i just wanted to blog something so got my logs from here and there.

Also this ilysmbidkhttybikydlmb <3, please don't google this.PLEASE\
P.s searching for anime pic was never so hard, also Bdae Blog soon??\
