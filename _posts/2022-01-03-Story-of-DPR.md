The trade route which connected medieval western countries to the east also known as the Silk road is by far one of the most important trade routes in the ancient history, but be not mistaken this article is not about medieval history  instead it is not even about the mastermind behind the new age Silk Road, the dark-web marketplace, which during the years in which it was active and not shut down by the FBI (active during 2011-2013) it generated over $1.2bn in sales and how he mastermind in establishing the said Silk Route, it is about how he was scammed online by a single person, but before that we need to know the backstory.

It is 2010 and a new certain currency known as Bitcoin was gaining traction, the selling point of this currency was the anonymity it gave to people currency not being centralised people started showing interest. Ross Ulbricht, took a keen interest in cryptocurrency particularly Bitcoin. Ross, also known as Dread Pirate Roberts, had started various new ventures but all failed to give any profits, he started interacting on bitcointalk.org, in October 2011 he made the last post on the website, but the most interesting one.

Going by the username “altoid” he seeked technical help for a bitcoin based venture, thereby laying foundations for what will be later known as Silk Road.

In the next couple of months Silk Road was born and soon became very popular, the traffic on the website was very good, and the anonymity for both sellers and buyers was the cherry on the cake. Ross went by Dread Pirate Roberts (short DPR), would handle the administration and various other stuff.

DPR would take a cut off the sellers, of his various sellers one of the most notable sellers was LucyDrop, he would mostly sell psychedelics and some other drugs. Lucy quickly rose through the ranks, and would become one of the top sellers. After some time he was nowhere to be seen on the Silk Road, people lost a lot of money, but this was not the first time something like this happened, this became a common practice, people began speculating that the same guy was behind all of this LucyDrop when all this was going around, another guy contacted DPR going by the name Friendly chemist.

Friendly Chemist claimed he was the supplier to LucyDrop and Lucy owed him money, and wanted DPR to pay him whilst blackmailing DPR  with leaking the records and identities of various sellers and buyers, DPR valued Silk Road and was put in a tight spot.The blackmailer said he need the money asap, because he in return owed money to the mafia from which he bought the supplies and they were out for him.DPR bought some time to think about this time and work about this.

Meanwhile the LucyDrop rose from the dead and came back to silk road (seems rather odd right). DPR contacted him about why he was out for so long to which he replied  was serving some time and in his absence his friend was running the account and scammed people on Silk Road. The thing to be noted is that DPR did not say anything about friendlychemist but still LucyDrop brought friendlychemist like he was mutual but that was not the case, which DPR seemed to miss which was an essential detail.Lucy said he would take care of that issue assured DPR that there would be no issue in future.

Weeks later friendlyChemist contacted DPR again blackmailing him again,to which furious DPR contacted Lucy, things got heated up and he wanted friendlychemist off the radar for once and all, but lucy drop refused the idea saying doing such would put lucydrop in a bad spotlight.Later DPR got into conversation and got the contact details of the original supplier going by the name redandwhite (reference to Hells Angels).

The talks went good with redandwhite ,with DPR inviting him to sell on the Silk Road directly cutting middleman. On the other side friendlychemist gave the ultimatum of 72 hours or else he would leak everything on the public forum.DPR got a deal with redandwhite to finally get a hitman to get friendlychemist off and paid redandwhite $150K in bitcoin to get the work done, he also wanted to get lucydrop and his gang out of the picture and paid another $750k in bitcoin.

When the FBI caught DPR and got a hold of his pc there was charges of murder against him, but there was no development, but in 2018 when Vancouver PD caught James Ellingson things got clear. It was revealed that LucyDrop and his Gang, FriendlyChemist, redandwhite were the same person all along, James Ellingson. James scammed DPR for $1m in bitcoin.

Some things to be noted, DPR had a tendency to overlook details, he leaked his personal address on a public forum, got scammed and was oblivious all along. The thing which surprised me the most was the lengths at which he could go to reach his goal of making Silk Road an underground empire, but all of this was in vain, and the FBI caught him for good. DPR now serves life imprisonment with no parole, while his family and various other NGOs fight for his justice, there is altogether a different take which his family have of DPR and his situation, and I was surprised by the amount of support they have, FBI completely shut the SIlk Road, but that didn't stop anything, various other such sites have come up over the time.
